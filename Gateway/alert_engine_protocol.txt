Feedback data from Node_Status and Garden_Status

opcode:
00 - daily report
01 - Bad valve state
02 - Mesh down
03 - Gateway self-reset
04 - Bad voltage state


Once a day:
Includes: numRegisteredNodes, %MeshUptime, %3GUptime, for each node { total accumulated flow, total watering time for each valve }
// add: percent of time garden was awake (will usually be 100%), for each node { maxed out flow meter, which valves are connected, percent of time node was awake }
00
//// NOT USED%{Garden_Status->numRegisteredNodes}(uint8_t) //// implied from the node portion
%{Garden_Status->percentGardenAwake}(float)
%{Garden_Status->percentMeshUptime}(float)
%{Garden_Status->percent3GUptime}(float)
///// NOTE: following is repeated for each registered node; each set inside {}
%nodeID(uint8_t)
%{Node_Status->meshState}(uint8_t)
%{Node_Status->percentNodeAwake}(float)
%{Node_Status->accumulatedFlow}(float)
%{Node_Status->maxedOutFlowMeter}(bool)--as '0' or '1'
///// NOTE: following is repeated for each connected valve; each set inside []
%valveNum(uint8_t)
%{Master->total_watering_time_per_valve}(uint16_t)

Ex.) 00%0.99%0.99%0.99%{%1%0%0.99%209.3%1%[%1%60%]%[%2%30%]%[%3%75%]%}

Alert cases:
1. Bad flow rate  (stuck on / stuck off)
01
%nodeID(uint8_t)
%{Valve_Status->flowState}(uint8_t)	(see SharedDefinitions.h)
%{Node_Status->currentFlowRate}(float)

Ex.) 01%1%5%0.00

2. Mesh down
02

3. Gateway self-reset
03

4. Bad voltage state
04
%nodeID(uint8_t)
%{Node_Status->voltageState}(uint8_t)	(see SharedDefinitions.h)

Ex.) 04%1%1


Special cases:
5. No modem response sends email via server)                                      ////// but the modem can't tell the server that it's down if it's down
"The GardeNet controller is not responding to the server. Please reset it!"
 
Note: this happens whenever the modem is NOT connected to the server for a long time (>5min?)

For myself: Server down (send SMS / email message via modem)
"The GardeNet server is down. Please reset it!"
