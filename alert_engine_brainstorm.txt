Feedback data from Node_Status and Garden_Status

opcode:
00 - daily report
01 - Bad valve state
02 - Mesh down
03 - Gateway self-reset
04 - Bad voltage state


Once a day:
Includes: numRegisteredNodes, %MeshUptime, %3GUptime, for each node { total accumulated flow, total watering time for each valve }
// add: percent of time garden was awake (will usually be 100%), for each node { maxed out flow meter, which valves are connected, percent of time node was awake }
00
%{Garden_Status->numRegisteredNodes}(uint8_t)
%{Garden_Status->percent_Garden_Uptime}
%{Garden_Status->percent_Mesh_Uptime}(float)
%{Garden_Status->percent_3G_Uptime}(float)
%nodeID(uint8_t)
%{Node_Status->percent_Node_Uptime}(float)
%{Node_Status->connected_Valves}(uint8_t seperated by |)
%{Node_Status->accumulatedFlow}(float)
%{Node_Status->maxedOutFlowMeter}(bool)
%{Master->total_watering_time_per_valve}(float in hours seperated by |)

Ex.) 00%1%0.99%0.99%0.99%1%50.5%1|2|3%209.3%false%1.11|1.25|1.38

Alert cases:
1. Bad valve state  (stuck on / stuck off) (includeflow rate?)
01
%{Garden_Status->which_Node}(uint8_t)
%{Node_Status->which_Valve}(uint8_t)
%{Valve_Status: on or off (the opposite of what it should be}(string)
%{Node_Status->currentFlowRate}(float)
// want to send: which node, which valve, what the state is

Ex.) 01%1%2%off%0.00

2. Mesh down
02

3. Gateway self-reset
03

4. Bad voltage state
04
%{Garden_Status->which_Node}
%{Node_Status->voltageState}(uint8_t)	(SharedDefinitions line 113 - 115)
// want to send: which node, what the state is

Ex.) 04%1%0


Special cases:
5. No modem response sends email via server)                                      ////// but the modem can't tell the server that it's down if it's down
"The GardeNet controller is not responding to the server. Please reset it!"
 
Note: this happens whenever the modem is NOT connected to the server for a long time (>5min?)

For myself: Server down (send SMS / email message via modem)
"The GardeNet server is down. Please reset it!"
