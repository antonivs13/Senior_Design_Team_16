/1. Introduction:/
//////////////////

  The GardeNet system was originally developed for Caledonia Community Garden
  (CCG) by Calvin College's Team 16. The team was comprised of four Electrical 
  Engineering majors: John Connell, Anthony Jin, Charles Kingston, and Kevin
  Kredit. Each member contributed to the success of the GardeNet system and 
  this manual is to help others operate the system successfully.


////////////////////////
/2. Operating GardeNet:/
////////////////////////

  In this section, the directions for operating the GardeNet system are laid
  out in steps to ensure ease of use for the consumer. Refer to the troubleshoot
  guide below for specific instructions of error correction.


  2.1. The Website
  ................

    The Website of GardeNet was designed to handle instructions of switches 
    and schedules that would be sent to the server and eventually onto the 
    gateway controlling the garden. The website is divided into two main
    components: the information and the controller. The information gives
    a basic About section and information about the GardeNet's system. The
    controller controls each portion of the garden and serves as a basic
    application to network with the rest of the components of the garden.

    The controller is also divided into two main sections: the guest view
    and the admin view. The guest view can observe the current schedule and
    the graph of the historical data. The admin view can have the same pages
    with a bit more functionality as well as pages designated for account 
    and alert settings. This manual is used to serve the controller portion
    of the website and all subsections of 2.1. will only reference the 
    controller section of the website.


    2.1.1. Guest View
    ................. 

      The Guest view of the website is comprised of two web pages. The first
      page is to view the last input schedule and the second is to view the
      historical data in graphs on the website. The schedule page has no 
      ability to change or edit the schedule in any way. It is merely a form
      that can be read as the user wishes and it is also to help a non-admin 
      user know the current schedule. The historical data page is much the
      same way. It does not have any ability to edit or alter anything in the
      garden but rather can only be used to view the graphical data and the 
      average radio network and 3G modem uptime.

    2.1.2. Admin View
    .................

      The Admin view of the website has a total of four web pages. Each page
      serves a different function that combined will help the user control 
      the garden from their PC, phone, or tablet. The first is the main admin
      page. This page is used to edit a schedule and other advanced options.
      The second is the historical data page. This page is much like the 
      guest version only it has the ability to download the data into a text
      file or delete the data completely. The third page is the alert setting
      page. It is used to alter the email address and cell phone number used
      to receive alerts and can also specify which kind of alerts the user
      would like to receive. The final page is the account settings page
      that is used to change the username and password used in accessing
      the admin pages of the website.

      2.1.2.1. Schedule Page
      ......................

        The schedule page includes user-friendly navigation between webpages 
        located at the upper-right corner of the screen. As you navigate
        down the page, a current forecast is shown with tomorrow's weather.
        The Garden Power switch displays the current power mode the garden
        is operating at. Awake means the garden is fully functioning and
        running on the current schedule. Sleep means the garden goes to 
        sleep for the rest of the day and all schedules are stopped.

        Further down the page is the actual schedule portion. The tabs
        above the card portion are the current zones that are being used
        and their respective names. The buttons above are used to add
        and delete zones up to a certain amount. Each zone tab has the
        same functionality.

        The zone tabs are first represented by their custom title. If the
        title is clicked, the user can change the name on the zone to 
        whatever they wish. Note that a longer title will create a larger
        tab space above. The upper-right portion of the card has advanced
        controls. These are used to change the node, valve, and weather
        sensitivity of the zone. Below the title are the events. To add
        an event, simply click the ADD button in the bottom left of the 
        card. Events are saved after each submission. Every event has three
        inputs: the day, the start time, and the stop time. The days are
        scheduled every week until changed. Please note that the events must
        have a start time earlier than the stop time to be submitted.

        When the schedule for each zone is done, click the submit button
        at the bottom to send the schedule to the server and to save the 
        schedule for the next user. The next time the page is accessed, 
        the schedule will be saved and ready to be altered.

      2.1.2.2. Historical Data
      ........................

        Historical data displays current information about the GardeNet 
        system. At the top, data of average percent uptime is displayed.
        Both the radio network out in the field and the 3G modem track
        the amount of time they're functioning and return it to the server.
        The data is shown in percents to give the user some comfort in
        knowing that the system works for a large amount of the time.

        Below the percentages are the graphical data. The first graph is overall
        water usage in the garden. Depending on the number of nodes, the data
        displays one line of daily flow per node and one line of cumulative flow
        per node. If more nodes were added, the graphical data should automatically
        adjust for the amount of nodes in the garden.

        The lower graph displays the time in minutes that each valve is 
        opened. The user can track this data and know which areas
        are being watered the most of the garden and which could 
        potentially need more watering. Note that if more valves or
        nodes are added, the system should automatically account for 
        them and create graphical data.

        The bottom buttons are for downloading the historical data
        text file to your own computer for personal records, or
        deleting the current historical data and starting with
        fresh data the next day.

        ***NOTE: If for any reason the graphical data does not
        display, it could be due to a parsing error on the side
        of the server. Options are to delete the current data and
        restart, download the data to see any abnormalities, or 
        contact John for any other concerns. ***

      2.1.2.3. Alert Settings
      .......................



      2.1.2.4. Account Settings
      .........................

  2.2. The Server
  ...............

    The server handles all of the communications between the gateway and the website.
    The communication scheme used for the server is TCP sockets. There are four different
    sockets used to handle the various applications needed for the GardeNet system. Of 
    these four sockets, only one socket connects to the outside world and the rest are 
    local loopback sockets that only allow connections from the same machine as itself.

    The server also implements some reliability features to assure the correct 
    functionaility of it throughout the day. Using a platform called Cron, the server is
    periodically tested with a script to assure that it is not caught in a software
    freeze.

    2.2.1 PORT 5530
    ...............

      Port number 5530 is the port that connects to the outside world. This means that port
      forwarding will need to be set up on the router of the network that the raspberry pi
      will be residing. The purpose of this socket is to continuously keep a TCP connection
      open with the gateway. The data is sent to and received from the gateway on this port.

    2.2.2 PORT 5535
    ...............

      Port number 5535 is the used to connect the website to the main server script. It is 
      bound to only allow connections from "<em>localhost</em>" which means it only allows 
      connections from the same machine(itself). When a connection is made on this port, it 
      identifies that the website has received a user's input to change the state of the 
      garden. The server then takes the state that the user has switched to and immediately 
      sends it to the gateway in order for the system to take the corrective actions. 

    2.2.3 PORT 5537
    ...............

      Port number 5537 is used to connect the website to the main server script running. When
      a connection is made on this port, it identifies that the website has received a user's 
      input of alert information. The server then forwards this information to the gateway so
      that it may handle all of the text message alerts.

    2.2.4 PORT 5538
    ...............

      

  2.3. The Gateway
  ................
    The gateway is the onsite controller that controls the nodes to turn individual valves
    on an off. It also actuates the GardeNet system's alert engine. One gateway can control
    up to 16 nodes and requires a Nimbelink 3G modem with a data plan activated. The following 
    describes how to use the gateway.
    
    2.3.1. Setting up the gateway
    ..............................
    
      Before using the gateway, set up the desired number of nodes following the procedures
      described in Section 2.4. Connect the gateway to a computer using an USB port. Open the 
      Arduino IDE program. Then open Tools/Serial Monitor to monitor the gateway's program. You
      should see the program running in the following sequence:
      
      -> The gateway is connected to the 3G network (Connection successful!)
      -> The gateway reports the total data usage in bytes since last time the 3G modem got reset
         (#GDATAVOL: socket number, total data usage, total data sent, total data received)
      -> The gateway retrieves an IP address (#SGACT:"IP Address")
      
      The gateway then proceeds to synchronize its internal timer and initiate connection with the
      GardeNet server. By the end of the setup routine, the gateway should have retrieved the alert
      setting, watering schedule, and state of the garden from the server. From this point on, the
      gateway reports the status of the garden every five seconds, and you can monitor:
    
      -> current time
      -> percent time garden awake
      -> connected nodes in the mesh network
      -> mesh network uptime
      -> 3G status
      -> 3G uptime
      -> Node states (if there is an issue)
      
      After the initial setup, the gateway does not have to be connected to a computer in order to
      work. If you are not concerned with monitoring these information, connect the gateway to an
      outlet using an AC/DC adaptor.

    2.3.2. Reset the gateway
    .........................
    
      If you believe the gateway is not running (e.g. no valve is turning on according to the
      schedule), hit the reset button on the upper right conner of the gateway and the gateway 
      program will restart.
      
    2.3.3. Toggle the garden state
    ..............................
    
      If you want to turn the garden awake or asleep, hit the toggle button on the gateway located
      to the left of the green LED. The garden will then toggle its state (e.g. awake -> asleep).
      
    2.3.4. Alert Engine
    ....................
    
      The gateway manages the alert engine for the GardeNet system. As mentioned in Section 2.1.2.3,
      you will receive an email or SMS message when there is an issue / alert available in the
      garden.
      
      
  2.4. The Nodes
  ..............

    The nodes are the devices that actually control the valves and flow rate meters. 
    It communicates wirelessly with and is controlled by the gateway. One node can 
    control between 0 and 4 valves and between 0 and 1 flow rate meters. The following
    sections describe how to setup, control, and interact with the device. The particulars
    of these instructions are specific to the prototype installed at CCG.
    
    2.4.1. Setting up a node
    ..........................
    
      Before applying power to the node, connect the desired number of valves and/or
      flow rate meters. To connect the valves, input the two leads in an ajacent pair
      of connecters in the green output terminal. The polarity of the leads does not matter.
      The pair closest to the black power switch corresponds to Valve 1. 
      
      In order to let the node know how many and which valves are connected, flip the
      red toggle switches on ('on' means pointing towards the black power switch). The
      first switch (closest to the power switch) corresponds to the first output in the
      terminal block.
      
      The presence of a flow rate meter is automatically detected. To connect the flow 
      rate meter, connect the three wires as follows, opposite the button: GREEN in row 
      37, YELLOW in row 38, and ORANGE in row 39.
      
      In order to differentiate the nodes, each has a unique ID between 1 and 16. The ID 
      is defined by pins A3 through A6 on the Arduino Nano. The ID is decoded from from 
      the pins, with pins connected to ground representing binary '1's and pins not 
      connected to ground considered '0's. For example, for a node with ID 1, only pin A3
      is grounded. An ID of 2 would have only A4 grounded. An ID of 9, for example, would 
      have pins A6 and A3 grounded. The special case is 16. To have an ID of 16, leave 
      all of the pins ungrounded.
      
      Once the above items are completed, the node is ready to be powered on. Connect a
      12V 5A (60W) DC power supply (provided for CCG). WHEN STARTING FOR THE FIRST TIME,
      OR AFTER ANY HARDWARE CHANGES, HOLD DOWN THE BLACK PUSHBUTTON WHILE POWER IS 
      APPLIED. The node is then running, and will connect and register itself with the
      gateway automatically.
      
    2.4.2. Controlling and Interacting with a Node
    ................................................
    
      The node is controlled according to the schedule the gateway, but can be interacted 
      with directly as well. Besides the red toggle switches, which are used only to 
      indicate attached valves, there are three ways to control the node: the power 
      switch, the pushbutton, and the reset button. The state of the node can be inferred
      from the state of the 5 red LEDs. 
      
      The power switch is the black rocker switch next to the input power connector. To 
      power on, rock the switch towards the outside of the node. To power off, rock the
      switch towards the green output terminal.
      
      The black pushbutton has two uses. If pressed during boot, the node refreshes its
      status and checks for a new hardware configuration (new valves or a new ID). If 
      pressed otherwise, it toggles the node between awake, which is normal behavior, and 
      asleep, which is where it turns off its valves and ignores valve commands from the
      gateway.
      
      The reset button restarts the node, which may help to alleviate certain types of 
      node errors.
      
      There are four LEDs arrayed next to the valve switches, and one next to the Arduino.
      The set of four each correlate to the state of its corresponding valve, where the 
      LED on means the vavle is open and the LED off means the valve is closed. The LED 
      closest to the green output terminal corresponds to Valve 1, and so on. The LED near
      the Arduino shows the state of the node. When it is on, it is disconnected from 
      the gateway; when it is off, it is connected. A short blink followed by a long 
      blink means it just turned awake; a long blink followed by a short blink means it 
      just turned asleep.
      
    2.4.3. Other comments
    .....................
      
      It is important to avoid getting the electronics wet, though a few drops will not
      damage them. It is okay for the connections on the valve to get wet; even fully
      submerged in water, they function correctly (yes we tested that). Lastly, the 
      node can be monitored using a serial connection through USB using a baud rate of 
      9600. HOWEVER, NEVER ATTACH THE USB IF THE NODE IS NOT POWERED ON--THIS WILL 
      DAMAGE THE POWER REGULATOR ON THE ARDUINO.

/3. Installation Guide:/
////////////////////////

  Installing GardeNet is designed to be fast and easy. Follow the following steps and 
  you will be on your way to an automated garden.
  
  3.1. Website and Server Setup and Installation
  ..............................................
    
    The website and server reside on a small computer called a Raspberry Pi (RPi). The 
    RPi can be physically located anywhere, such as a home or church office. In order 
    for it to function, it needs (1) and internet connection and (2) port forwarding
    for the web server. 
    
    The internet connection can be through either ethernet or Wi-Fi. The team does not
    provide a Wi-Fi dongle for the RPi, but does provide an ethernet cable.
    
    Port forwarding needs to be configured on the router through which the RPi is 
    connected to the internet so that it can respond to port 80 and port 5530 requests. 
    Port 80 is used to host the website, gardenet.ddns.net, and port 5530 is used to 
    communicate with the gateway. (You may want to forward port 22 as well, so that 
    you or the team can use SSH for updates and maintenance.) To enable port forwarding 
    on these ports, refer to the instructions for your router.
    
  3.2. Gateway and Nodes Setup and Installation
  .............................................
  
    The gateway must be on location. All that the user has to do is provide power in
    a secure, waterproof shelter. The gateway uses the Verizon network, so check that
    Verizon covers your area. 
    
    Once the setup procedure in section 2.4.1 has been completed, simply connect the 
    pipes or hoses (the CCG version comes with 1/2 FIP valves fitted with 3/4" hose
    adapters) and provide power. Your system is now up and running.
  
  
/////////////////////
/4. Troubleshooting:/
/////////////////////

  This section addresses each problem in terms of "problem"-"possible causes"-"course
  of action". If the suggested course of action does not solve the problem, contact
  the team with the information provided below.
  
  PROBLEM: The website will not load or is unresponsive.
  POSSIBLE CAUSES: The RPi may have crashed or entered a bad state. The Dynamic DNS
    client may be down. The Dynamic DNS provider may have stopped supporting
    GardeNet due to a failure to register or renew the domain name.
  COURSE OF ACTION: First, restart the RPi. If the RPi is given a new IP address by
    your DHCP server (most likely your router), then the DDNS client may take a
    while to resolve "gardenet.ddns.net" to the new IP address and/or you may have
    to reconfigure the port forwarding on your router.
    If that does not work, check your account with noip.com to ensure that they
    are still providing DNS services for GardeNet.
    
  PROBLEM: Are not receiving email or text alerts.
  POSSIBLE CAUSES: You may have turned alerts off. The system may be sending the 
    alerts to a different email address or phone number. The system may 
    (correctly or erroneously) not be generating alerts.
  COURSE OF ACTION: In the "Alert Settings" tab in the admin portion of the website,
    check the boxes for the types of alerts that you want. To confirm that it is 
    working, force the system into a situation that will generate an alert for 
    which you are subscribed (such as restarting the gateway, perhaps).
    If you do not begin receiving alerts, re-enter your information. NOTE: as of the 
    date of installation at CCG, the system supports sending alerts to only one 
    email address and one phone number.
  
  PROBLEM: Cannot unsubscribe from email or text alerts via email or text.
  POSSIBLE CAUSES: GardeNet does not support this feature.
  COURSE OF ACTION: To stop receiving alerts, you may unsubscribe using the check-
    boxes in the "Alert Settings" tab. You may also enter an empty email address
    and phone number.
  
  PROBLEM: Are receiving too many email or text alerts.
  POSSIBLE CAUSES: The system may send more alerts than you desire. The system may
    be sending false-positives.
  COURSE OF ACTION: If the system is sending you more alerts than you want to 
    receive, then you may unsubscribe using the check-boxes in the "Alert Settings" 
    tab. If it is generating false-positives, then unsubscribe from the alert and
    record the situation and let the team know.
  
  PROBLEM: The gateway is using more data then the dataplan allows for (>1 MB).
  POSSIBLE CAUSES: The gateway is rebooting or generating alerts more than it 
    should be.
  COURSE OF ACTION: Unsubscribe from text alerts (unsubscribing from email alerts
    will not save data). If the problem persists, then pay the overage fee (only 
    $2 for each extra MB). Nimbelink has previously indicated that it will likely
    update its plans soon (as of spring 2016), offering more data at lower costs.
    The only other option is to disable the system; GardeNet does not currently 
    offer Wi-Fi or wired connection options.
  
  PROBLEM: The node will not connect to the gateway.
  POSSIBLE CAUSES: The mesh network may be failing to connect. The gateway may 
    not recognize the node even if the node thinks it is connected.
  COURSE OF ACTION: First, reboot the node. If that does not work, reboot the 
    gateway and the node (the node may take up to 5 minutes to connect).
